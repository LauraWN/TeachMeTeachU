Greetings!

In your Github repository, include a readme.md that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

<b>Why did you choose this subject?</b>

Have you ever wondered how web developers make those nifty scrolling web sites and what is that called? Have you ever wondered why people answer a question with a question? Well the answer to the first question is "Yes! It's called parallax." The answer to the second question is unknown.

<b>How were you first made aware of it?</b>
Sometimes, when browsing the web, I would come across a web site with backgrounds that would move differently than usual. I found out this is called parallax.

<b>What problem does it solve?</b>
It provides an "animated" effect to web sites, giving a flat two-dimensional surface a three-dimensional-like quality.

<b>How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?</b>
It assigns variables to the foreground and backround pieces of a web site and allows you to move them separately.

<b>Why does one use it?</b>
It provides some interest to ordinary bullet points and exposition on a web site and can enhance a web user's experience on your web page.

<b>What are the alternatives?</b>
Flash can provide animation to web sites, but isn't supported on mobile devices, and using Flash requires a dependence on a vendor (Adobe). Also, many users have their browsers set to block plugins, such as the Flash player.

<b>What is it similar to, if anything?</b>
It's similar to other CCS animation techniques that are used to move objects across the page.

<b>What is the history of this technology?</b>
According to Wikipedia, parallax was developed out of traditional animation techniques developed in the 1930s. Some games in the early 1980s used parallax-like scrolling and later parallax was incorporated into CSS3 and HTML5 for use by web developers.

<b>Who built it and why?</b>
It was built by the CSS3 working group to provide open-source access to animation-type effects.

<b>Who is maintaining it?</b>
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) works on the specifications for cascading style sheets (CSS) and hypertext markup language (HTML) so they are responsible for maintaining parallax as a part of these two languages.

<b>What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?</b>

<b>What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?</b>

<b>What resources do you recommend for interested students?</b>

<b>What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?</b>

<b>What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?<b>
