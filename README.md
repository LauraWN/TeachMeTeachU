Greetings!

In your Github repository, include a readme.md that answers the following questions regarding your subject. No need to write a book!

Why did you choose this subject?
Have you ever wondered how web developers make those nifty scrolling web sites and what is that called? Have you ever wondered why people answer a question with a question? Well the answer to the first question is "Yes! It's called parallax." The answer to the second question is unknown.

How were you first made aware of it?
Sometimes, when browsing the web, I would come across a web site with backgrounds that would move differently than usual. I found out this is called parallax.

What problem does it solve?
It provides an "animated" effect to web sites, giving a flat two-dimensional surface a three-dimensional-like quality.

How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
It assigns variables to the foreground and backround pieces of a web site and allows you to move them separately.

Why does one use it?
It provides some interest to ordinary bullet points and exposition on a web site and can enhance a web user's experience on your web page.

What are the alternatives?
Flash can provide animation to web sites, but isn't supported on mobile devices, and using Flash requires a dependence on a vendor (Adobe). Also, many users have their browsers set to block plugins, such as the Flash player.

What is it similar to, if anything?
It's similar to other CCS animation techniques that are used to move objects across the page.

What is the history of this technology?
According to Wikipedia, parallax was developed out of traditional animation techniques developed in the 1930s. Some games in the early 1980s used parallax-like scrolling and later parallax was incorporated into CSS3 and HTML5 for use by web developers.

Who built it and why?
It was built by the CSS3 working group to provide open-source access to animation-type effects.

Who is maintaining it?
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) works on the specifications for cascading style sheets (CSS) and hypertext markup language (HTML) so they are responsible for maintaining parallax as a part of these two languages.

What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?

What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?

What resources do you recommend for interested students?

What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?

What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
